# Transducers for Go

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sdboyer/transducers-go.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sdboyer/transducers-go)

This is an implementation of transducers, a concept from [Clojure](http://clojure.org), for Go.

Transducers can be tricky to understand with just an abstract description, but here it is:

> Transducers are a composable way to build reusable algorithmic transformations.

Transducers were introduced in Clojure for a sorta-similar reason that `range` exists in Go: because they wanted one way of writing element-wise operations on channels *and* other collection structures (though that's just the tip of the iceberg).

I'm honestly not sure if I these are a good idea for Go or not. I've written this library as an exploratory experiment in their utility/applicability to Go, and would love feedback on transducers' utility for Go.

## What Transducers are

There's a lot out there already, no need to duplicate it here. Instead, know that this library attempts to faithfully reproduce their behaviors in Go, meaning that anything about how they *ought* to work as defined elsewhere, should hold true here.

Here's some resources - mostly in Clojure, of course:

* Rich Hickey's [StrangeLoop talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mTbuzafcII) introducing transducers (and his recent [ClojureConj talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KqUvG8HPYo))
* The [Clojure docs](http://clojure.org/transducers) page for transducers
* [Some](https://gist.github.com/ptaoussanis/e537bd8ffdc943bbbce7) [high-level](https://bendyworks.com/transducers-clojures-next-big-idea/) [summaries](http://thecomputersarewinning.com/post/Transducers-Are-Fundamental/) of transducers
* Some [examples](http://ianrumford.github.io/blog/2014/08/08/Some-trivial-examples-of-using-Clojure-Transducers/) of [uses](http://matthiasnehlsen.com/blog/2014/10/06/Building-Systems-in-Clojure-2/) for transducers...mostly just toy stuff
* A couple [blog](http://blog.podsnap.com/ducers2.html) [posts](http://conscientiousprogrammer.com/blog/2014/08/07/understanding-cloure-transducers-through-types/) examining type issues with transducers

If trying to read Clojure makes your eyes cross (me too, I learned just enough to grok for this), I first learned what transducers are and how they work by reading about [this adaptation in javascript](http://phuu.net/2014/08/31/csp-and-transducers.html).

## Pudding <- Proof

I'm calling this proof of concept "done" because [it can pretty much replicate](http://godoc.org/github.com/sdboyer/transducers-go#ex-package--ClojureParity) a [very thorough example](https://gist.github.com/sdboyer/9fca652f492257f35a41) Rich Hickey put out there.

Here's some quick eye candy, though:

```go
// dot import for brevity, remember this is a nono
import . "github.com/sdboyer/transducers-go"

func main() {
	// To make things work, we need four things (definitions in glossary):
	// 1) an input stream
	input := Range(4) // ValueStream containing [0 1 2 3]
	// 2) a stack of Transducers
	transducers := []Transducer{Map(Inc), Filter(Even)} // increment then filter odds
	// 3) a reducer to put at the bottom of the transducer stack
	reducer := Append() // very simple reducer - just appends values into a []interface{}
	// 4) a processor that puts it all together
	result := Transduce(input, reducer, transducers...)

	fmt.Println(result) // [2 4]


	// Or, we can use the Go processor, which does the work in a separate goroutine
	// and returns results through a channel.

	// Make an input chan, and stream each value from Range(4) into it
	in_chan := make(chan interface{}, 0)
	go StreamIntoChan(Range(4), in_chan)

	// Go provides its own bottom reducer (that's where it sends values out through
	// the return channel). So we don't provide one - just the input channel. Note
	// that we can safely reuse the transducer stack we declared earlier.
	out_chan := Go(in_chan, 0, transducers...)

	result2 := make([]interface{}, 0) // zero out the slice
	for v := range out_chan {
		result2 = append(result2, v)
	}

	fmt.Println(result) // [2 4]
}
```

## The Arguments

I figure there's pros and cons to something like this. Makes sense to put em up front.

Please feel free to send PRs with more things to put in this section :)

### Cons

* Dodges around the type system - there is little to no compile-time safety here.
* To that end: is Yet Another Generics Attemptâ„¢...though, see [#1](https://github.com/sdboyer/transducers-go/issues/1).
* Syntax is not as fluid as Clojure's (though creating such things is kind of a Lisp specialty).
* Pursuant to all of the above, it'd be hard to call this idiomatic Go.
* The `ValueStream` notion is a bedrock for this system, and has significant flaws.
* Since this is based on streams/sequences/iteration, there will be cases where it is unequivocally less efficient than batch processing (slices).
* Performance in general. While Reflect is not used at all (duh), I haven't done perf analysis yet, so I'm not sure how much overhead we're looking at. The stream operations in particular (splitting, slice->stream->slice) probably mean a lot of heap allocs and duplication of data.

### Pros

* Stream-based data processing - so, amenable to dealing with continuous/infinite/larger-than-memory datasets.
* Sure, channels let you be stream-based. But they're [low-level primitives](https://gist.github.com/kachayev/21e7fe149bc5ae0bd878). Plus they're largely orthogonal to this, which is about decomposing processing pipelines into their constituent parts.
* Transducers could be an interesting, powerful way of structuring applications into segments, or for encapsulating library logic in a way that is easy to reuse, and whose purpose is widely understood.
* While the loss of type assurances hurts - a lot - the spec for transducer behavior is clear enough that it's probably feasible to aim at "correctness" via exhaustive black-box tests. (hah)
* And about types - I found a little kernel of something useful when looking beyond parametric polymorphism - [more here](https://github.com/sdboyer/transducers-go/issues/1).

## Glossary

Transducers have some jargon. Here's an attempt to cut it down. These go more or less in order.

* **Reduce:** If you're not familiar with the general concept of reduction, [LMGTFY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)).
* **Reduce Step:** A [function](http://godoc.org/github.com/sdboyer/transducers-go#ReduceStep)/method with a reduce-like signature: `(accum, value) return`
* **Reducer:** A [set of three](http://godoc.org/github.com/sdboyer/transducers-go#Reducer) functions - the Reduce Step, plus Complete and Init methods.
* **Transducer:** A function that *transforms* a *reducing* function. They [take a reducing func and return another](http://godoc.org/github.com/sdboyer/transducers-go#Transducer).
* **Predicate:** Some transducers - for example, [Map](http://godoc.org/github.com/sdboyer/transducers-go#Map) and [Filter](http://godoc.org/github.com/sdboyer/transducers-go#Filter) - take a function to do their work. These injected functions are referred to as predicates.
* **Transducer stack:** In short: `[]Transducer`. A stack is stateless (it's just logic) and can be reused in as many processes as desired.
* **Bottom reducer:** The reducer that a stack of transducers will operate on.
* **Processor:** Processors take (at minimum) some kind of collection and a transducer stack, compose a transducer pipeline from the stack, and apply it across the elements of the collection.
